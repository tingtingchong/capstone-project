## Problem statement

I've always had an interest in psychology. At some point I wanted to pursue a research masters in personality psychology but life happened and I decided to continue with my career in digital marketing. 

Mental illness has been in the limelight of society in recent years for good reason. According to the World Health Organization, "Depression is one of the leading causes of disability. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. People with severe mental health conditions die prematurely – as much as two decades early – due to preventable physical conditions." 

I hope to explore insights and predictions on how various factors can affect depression including:

- whether personality traits can predict depression and anxiety and if so,
  which personality traits have a bigger effect on predicting depression and anxiety 
- whether demographic information can predict depression and anxiety and
  which demographic information has a bigger effect on predicting depression and anxiety
- exploring how demographic information and personality traits interact to predict depression and anxiety
- using our findings, predict the depression level of a test taker

## Hypothesis and Assumptions

1. High neuroticism is the greatest personality predictor for Depression and Anxiety
2. Introversion and Extroversion don't affect negative emotional states unless the individual is also highly neurotic,
   in which case introverts exhibited a predisposition towards depression and anxiety 
3. Conscientiousness has a negative relationship with Depression and Anxiety
4. Individuals with lesser educational opportunities and the gender female are predictors for higher levels of Depression and        Anxiety

## Goals and success metrics

Aside from the points I've listed above, the main goal is to understand how personality and demographic information can predict depression levels.

## Risks or limitations

As this is a self report measure, individuals may not be honest with their responses and can be prone to social desirability bias i.e. answering the questions in a way that will be viewed favourably by others. An individual may also submit their responses more than once, creating a bias on the dataset. When taking the questionnaire, words like "hard worker" can also be open to interpretation. 

## Dataset

Taken from Kaggle, this data set combines the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale with the Ten Item Personality Inventory.
Demographic information is included. This datatset comes from those who agreed to complete the research survey and answered yes to the question "Have you given accurate answers and may they be used for research?" at the end.
